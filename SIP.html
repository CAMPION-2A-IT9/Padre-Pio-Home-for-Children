			<p> Determining the Effective Dosage of Tea Bag Compost for the growth of the Brassica rapa Chinensis<br>
			Will the Tea bag compost do any change or improvement to the plant? will it improve the growth and give the plant<br>
			more nutrients?<br>
			Group 2A presents to you the TEA BAG COMPOST for the growth of BRASSICA RAPA CHINESIS.<br>
			This compost is not only budget friendly but it also has many nutrients and benefits <br>
			for the plant, pichay.

		<h2 class="">Hypothesis</h2>				
		<h4>By: Athena Dominguez and Jannah Sulit</h4>				
			<img src="soil.jpg"/>
			<p>
			If we will use tea bags as compost, then it will make the growth rate of the Brassica rapa Chinensis (Pechay) faster?<br>
			Independent Variable : Different dosage(amount) of Tea bags compost <br>
			Dependent Variable : Growth of the Brassica rapa chinensis (Pichay)
			<br>
			Will this experiment make drastic or small changes in our pichay? Will the teabag give a positive effect,<br>
			and benefits?

			<p>
			This compost consist of GALLIC ACID <br>
			(Gallic acid (GA), a plant-derived polyphenolic compound, <br>
			is a well-known antioxidant, antihyperglycemic, <br>
			and anti-lipid peroxidative and agents. <br>
			Recently, GA treatment improved plant responses to some abiotic stresses.),<br> CHLOROGENIC ACID,
			<br> Chlorogenic acid is a beneficial polyphenol found in plants that are<br>
			well known for its nutritional antioxidant properties in plant-based foods.<br>
			In addition to its antioxidant activity in the diet,<br>
			it has been shown to be an effective defense molecule against a variety of insect herbivores.
